
h3. Dynamic Where clause construction

The following method builds a query with a dynamically varying where clause, the *.?* function on the optional parameters has the effect of removing the enclosing condition when the argument is None.

* *Note* the .? operator is just a shorthand for the inhibitWhen(b: Boolean) methods that applies on any AST node

{% highlight scala %}

  def dynamicWhereOnArtists(firstName: Option[String], lastName: Option[String]) =
      from(artists)(a =>
        where(
          (a.firstName === firstName.?) and
          (a.lastName like lastName.?)
        )
        select(a)
      )
{% endhighlight %}

Observe how following calls affect the generated SQL : 

{% highlight scala %}
 
    val q1 = dynamicWhereOnArtists(None, None)
       
    val q2 = dynamicWhereOnArtists(None, Some("S%"))
    
    val q3 = dynamicWhereOnArtists(Some("Poncho"), Some("S%"))

{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight sql %}

-- q1 :
Select
  Person1.age as Person1_age,
  Person1.timeOfLastUpdate as Person1_timeOfLastUpdate,
  Person1.lastName as Person1_lastName,
  Person1.firstName as Person1_firstName,
  Person1.id as Person1_id
From
  Person Person1

--q2 :  
Select
  Person1.age as Person1_age,
  Person1.timeOfLastUpdate as Person1_timeOfLastUpdate,
  Person1.lastName as Person1_lastName,
  Person1.firstName as Person1_firstName,
  Person1.id as Person1_id
From
  Person Person1
Where
  ((Person1.lastName like ?) )
  
  
--q3 :
 
Select
  Person1.age as Person1_age,
  Person1.timeOfLastUpdate as Person1_timeOfLastUpdate,
  Person1.lastName as Person1_lastName,
  Person1.firstName as Person1_firstName,
  Person1.id as Person1_id
From
  Person Person1
Where
  ((Person1.firstName = ?) and (Person1.lastName like ?))  
{% endhighlight %}



* *Note* the .? operator is just a shorthand for the inhibitWhen(b: Boolean) methods that applies on any AST node, it translates into a.inhibitWhen(a === None)

The same method using inhibitWhen would be :

{% highlight scala %}

  def dynamicWhereOnArtists(firstName: Option[String], lastName: Option[String]) =
      from(artists)(a =>
        where(
          (a.firstName === firstName.inhibitWhen(firstName == None)) and
          (a.lastName like lastName.inhibitWhen(lastName == None))
        )
        select(a)
      )
{% endhighlight %}
