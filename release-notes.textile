*    Closes #43: Equality expression not reversible in OneToMany
*    fixes #2: Support query pagination in DerbyAdapter
*    implicit conversion from boolean to LogicalBoolean, to allow this kind of syntax sugar :
<pre>      
    students.where(s => s.isMultilingual)
  as opposed to :
    students.where(s=> s.isMultilingual===true)    
</pre>

*    added Derby support
*    Quote identifiers in emitted SQL
*    Fix for issue 89 : update(T)(t => where(t.id in (subselect)) set(...))" generates invalid SQL

h3. 0.9.4-RC2
